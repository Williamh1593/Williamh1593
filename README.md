- 👋 Hi, I’m @Williamh1593
- 👀 I’m interested in making money legally
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing as ive learned what i need to know
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hedge bets for the lottery. If you go to numbergenerator.org and run a lotto list simulation youll see that it is split between 5 list, however when comparing the 5 list against each other there are repeats as order does not matter between all the list due to order doesnt matter in the first place.. essientially i am looking for someone that can build a number generator that will output 1 list that contains all the numbers. I will peer review the list of numbers (might take a while) essientally what this lottery hack does is when in mass against other players you will always profit. This is due to low base odds for state run lotteries.. ill explain more once we colloborate.. #currently have no money, willing to split fairly if u hedge the money say i get a very very low percentage based on providing this knowledge, fair is fair i helped you so please be kind to me
